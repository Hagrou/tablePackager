#Table Packager 

![alt text](../images/tablePackager.png "table Packager")

The aims of Table Packager is to gather all the files of a pinball table (table, rom, media, etc.) 
in a single compressed file, a compressed package. You can edit it, add file or info and then 
deploy it on you pincab or distribute it on the web.

For the moment, you can extract table and media files from Pinball X, PinUp System and Visual Pinball X.

A package can be installed on Pin Up System and Visual Pinball (Pinballx is not available on installation
because I don't know how Pinball X links media files with it's internal data)
